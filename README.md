This program can crack PDF fileâ€™s password.

- hello dear user

- this program only for educational purpose do not use for making problems 

- i am not responsible for any causing harm 

- i made this program to test my skills , this program is for cracking PDF file's password

- the program so simple and basics 

- you need these things:
   > pip install PyPDF2
   > pip install os
   > pip install colorama

- the program made by using Python3 at first you have to enter the PDF file, put it into the folder , or call it out side the folder , then it ask for the password list , i already made 3 types of passwordlist for you that contain many random passwords and "rockyou" which people use by default , also one file called costum.txt , which you can add your mind's password or those passwords that you info geathered (this one need social engineering skills)

the rockyou file which is i renamed for passlist01.txt is about 125MB i couldn't upload so i changed for a link :

 put this file into PDF-CRACKER folder  to be accessed

using this program is easy , just upload the locked PDF file into PDF-CRACKER folder and then call it back it start cracking.
